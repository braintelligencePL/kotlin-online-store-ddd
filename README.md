There is a lot of names for this type of architecture. Each of us has different style for the same thing. You'll find here  combination of various good practices. Some of which are hype terms like DDD, TDD practices along with hexagonal architecture. We'll try to keep high cohesion and low coupling. You'll see what that means.

## Tech stack: 
- Kotlin
- Spring

#### ðŸ“¦ `step-1-starter` - basic structure of the project. 

ðŸ“œ Shows separation of domain and infrastructure. 

**Domain (offer, offer-api)** - contains only pure `Kotlin` code (business code) and does not contain `Spring` (infrastructure) dependencies. In our application representation of domain is `offer` and `offer-api`.

**Infrastructure (app)** - contains `Spring` dependencies. Rest, Soap, GraphQL and all other things like logging, search engines, queues in other words everything that is connected with the outside world (cloud, database and other).

#### ðŸ“¦ `step-2-offer-api` - offer api design

ðŸ“œ We can easily say that `offer` and `offer-api` is a microservice. It's separated from other modules and it can be easily moved to another separate repository if needed. High cohesion means keeping parts of a code base that are related to each other in a single place. Low coupling, at the same time, is about separating unrelated parts of the code base as much as possible. That's exactly what we want to achieve.

**offer-api** - other modules can interact with `offer` via `offer-api`. In that case `OfferAPI.kt` is a facade for the module. All the models that reside in `offer-api` are for public use. Thanks to that we have clear separations of concerns.

**offer** - implementation of `offer-api`. Business logic. All nitty-gritty details of our app.

**shared-kernel** - module that contains all the things that will be shared between other modules (microservices) like `offer`, `cart`, `order`, `payment`.

We also introduced error handling. Our domain has `Either<OfferError, OfferResponse>` which is pretty much self-explanatory. `Either.left` is some known error and `Either.right` is correct value. Important thing is that left side of the `Either` is known error that is checked


#### ðŸ§±Addons
- **[facade](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/facade) (design pattern)** - provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. In our case `OfferAPI.kt` is a facade.
