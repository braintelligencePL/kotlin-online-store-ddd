There is a lot of names for this type of architecture. Each of us has different style for the same thing. You'll find here  combination of various good practices. Some of which are hype terms like DDD, TDD practices along with hexagonal architecture. We'll try to keep high cohesion and low coupling. You'll see what that means.

## Tech stack: 
- Kotlin
- Spring

## Branches:

#### ðŸ“¦ `step-1-starter` - basic structure of the project. 

ðŸ“œ Shows separation of domain and infrastructure. 

**Domain (offer, offer-api)** - contains only pure `Kotlin` code (business code) and does not contain `Spring` (infrastructure) dependencies. In our application representation of domain is `offer` and `offer-api`.

**Infrastructure (app)** - contains `Spring` dependencies. Rest, Soap, GraphQL and all other things like logging, search engines, queues in other words everything that is connected with the outside world (cloud, database and other).

#### ðŸ“¦ `step-2-offer-api` - offer api design

ðŸ“œ We can easily say that `offer` and `offer-api` is a microservice. It's separated from other modules and it can be easily moved to another separate repository if needed. High cohesion means keeping parts of a code base that are related to each other in a single place. Low coupling, at the same time, is about separating unrelated parts of the code base as much as possible. That's exactly what we want to achieve.

**offer-api** - other modules can interact with `offer` via `offer-api`. In that case `OfferAPI.kt` is a facade for the module. All the models that reside in `offer-api` are for public use. Thanks to that we have clear separations of concerns.

**offer** - implementation of `offer-api`. Business logic. All nitty-gritty details of our app.

**shared-kernel** - module that contains all the things that will be shared between modules like `offer`, `cart`, `order`, `payment`.

We also introduced error handling. Our domain has `Either<OfferError, OfferResponse>` which is pretty much self-explanatory. `Either.left` is some known error and `Either.right` is the correct value. Important thing is that left side of the `Either` is known error that is represented by `sealed class OfferError()`. In other words we only have restricted `OfferErrors` that our domain can generate. There is only room for the things we expected. No room for NullPointerExceptions and other not expected Exceptions. Generally we want simple and clear error shown to the frontend developer like below: 

```json
{
    "offerId": "111",
    "status": "NOT_FOUND",
    "title": "Offer with id=111 not found"
}
```

**Flow of the error handling:**

1. `AppThrowableError` from `shared-kernel`. We ignore things that we don't want. Frontend developer doesn't need our stacktrace just relevant information for him. 
2. `AppError` from `shared-kernel`. Generic class that is inherited by `OfferError`.
3. `OfferError` from `offer-api`. It is a sealed class with restricted errors known by our domain. In other words, errors that we know might happen during runtime of our application.  
4. `AppExceptionHandler` from `app` which is our infrastructure. Mapping models from domain to infrastructure. Simply we create `ResponseEntity` which is `Spring` related thing. Here is create JSON that was shown above. 

#### ðŸ§±Addons
- **[facade](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/facade) (design pattern)** - provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. In our case `OfferAPI.kt` is a facade.
